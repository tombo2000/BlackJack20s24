Blackjack Game

Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack, built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user 
interface (GUI).

How to Play

Click the "Deal" button to start a new game.
You will be dealt two cards, face up.

The computer will be dealt two cards, with one face up (the "Computer's first card") and the other face down (the "hidden card").

You can choose to either "Hit" to receive another card or "Stand" to stick with your current hand.

If you go over 21, you lose the game.

If you stand, the computer will reveal its hidden card and play according to a set of predetermined rules.

The game will then determine the winner based on the final scores.
